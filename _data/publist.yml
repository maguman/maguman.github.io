  description: 
  key1: We propose a fully three-dimensional edge-finite-element algorithm for simulating CSEM surveys.
  key2: We compare the performance between direct and iterative solvers.
  key3: The results show the superior efficiency of direct solvers, particularly for multisource problems.

- title: "Three-dimensional inversion of controlled-source electromagnetic data using general measures to evaluate data misfits and model structures"
  journal: Geophysical Prospecting
  volume: 
  doi: 10.1111/1365-2478.13576
  year: 2024

  description: 
  key1: We developed a new 3D controlled-source electromagnetic inversion algorithm that allows general measures to be made selectively available.
  key2: The behaviours of general measures for evaluating data misfits and model structures are examined focusing on weighting mechanism and user-defined paramenters.
  key3: Our findings highlight the seamless integration of general measures, contributing to improved robustness against data outliers and enhanced spatial properties provided in output models.
