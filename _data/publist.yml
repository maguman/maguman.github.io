- title: "Three-dimensional modelling of controlled-source electromagnetic surveys using an edge finite-element method with a direct solver"
  journal: Geophysical Prospecting
  volume: 62(6)
  doi: 10.1111/1365-2478.12132
  year: 2014

  description: 
  key1: We propose a fully three-dimensional edge-finite-element algorithm for simulating CSEM surveys.
  key2: We compare the performance between direct and iterative solvers.
  key3: The results show the superior efficiency of direct solvers, particularly for multisource problems.

- title: "3D CSEM inversion using general measures for evaluating data fidelity and model regularity"
  journal: SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts
  volume: 
  doi: 10.1190/segam2017-17782581.1
  year: 2017

  description: 
  key1: We adopt general measures - L2, L1, Huber, Hybrid, Sech, Cauchy, L0 for measuring data fidelity and model regularity.
  key2: We illustrate different features of general measures through synthetic experiments.
  key3: The use of general measures ensures high-fidelity data-fitting and provides a way to emphasize certain desirable attributes.
